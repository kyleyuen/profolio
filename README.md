## About

This portfolio highlights my expertise as a web developer with strong foundations in C++, Python, and frontend technologies. It features smooth CSS animations and layered visual effects, all implemented without JavaScript, ensuring lightweight and fast performance.

## Features

- **Hero Section:** Animated introduction with name, skills, and contact button using CSS keyframe animations.  
- **About Section:** Visually engaging layered background with fade and scale animations triggered by CSS scroll timeline and animation-timeline properties.  
- **Skills Section:** Clean, pill-shaped skill badges with hover effects.  
- **Projects Section:** Modular project cards with hover lift and shadow effects.  
- **Contact Section:** Styled contact info and external links with hover states.  
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
- **Pure CSS Animations:** All animations and transitions are done with CSS only, no JavaScript required.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, animations, scroll-timeline, media queries)  
- **No JavaScript** — all interactivity and animations are CSS-based.
